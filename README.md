- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AnnaChurchill

I have recently graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science.
I have significant experience in languges:
- python
- java
- C
- r

and I am currently learning languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

My current project is learning to build a website, and eventually create a working blog.

I hope in future to take on many personal projects to expand my knowledge and capabilites to make me more adaptable for future job oportunities, as well as gain a greater understnding of the work of future colleagues and collaborators.
My current projects have confirmed my love and preference of back-end and logic based programming, and I aim for a career in this field.  

I am definitely interested in collaboration on projects as well, and it would be great to work with and learn from others in different areas.

You can get in touch with me via my email: annalouisechurchill@gmail.com
